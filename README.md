## Overview

**sleepHabits** leverages advanced NLP and data engineering workflows to process survey data collected in multiple languages. The project focuses on translating survey responses to English using a combination of libraries for accuracy, cleaning and structuring the data, and preparing it for machine learning analysis. The ultimate goal is to extract features and build models that can predict or classify sleep patterns based on survey responses.

## Key Features

- **Multilingual Data Translation:** Uses two translation libraries to ensure reliability and accuracy when converting survey responses to English.
- **NLP Processing:** Employs spaCy and other NLP tools for tokenization, entity recognition, and text normalization.
- **Data Engineering:** Handles large survey datasets with robust cleaning, transformation, and feature extraction pipelines.
- **ML Model Development:** Prepares labeled data for machine learning, enabling classification or regression tasks on sleep patterns.
- **Error Handling & Debugging:** Emphasizes reliability and resilience in both Python and Java environments.

## Technologies Used

- Python (core logic and pipelines)
- spaCy (NLP processing)
- Translation libraries (e.g., googletrans, deep-translator, etc.)
- Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
- scikit-learn (ML models)
- Jupyter Notebook (experimentation and analysis)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdelrahmanMohmmed/sleepHabits.git
   cd sleepHabits
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Open the main notebook:**
